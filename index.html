  	<h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
  	<p>
  		Hi, my name is Matthew Madden, and I am thrilled to have you here at my portfolio site. This site has two goals: 
  		<ol>
  			<li>To showcase the projects that I am working on, or have completed, so that you can get a feel for my abilities and coding interests</li>
  			<li>To help you learn more about me! (Sounds selfish, but I guess that's kind of the nature of a portfolio)</li>
  		</ol>
		 There are a few things in life I am all about: My family and friends, music, and code.<br><br>An awesome morning for me is waking up early, brewing a baller cup of joe, and learning new coding skills. If I were to practice guitar after that, to top things off, then damn: that's a pretty great morning.
